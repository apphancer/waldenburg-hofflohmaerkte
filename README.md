# Waldenburg Hofflohmärkte

## Overview

The **Waldenburg Hofflohmärkte** is an exciting community event taking place on **October 31st 2025**, where residents from Pfarrgrund to Ziegeleiweg, and even in Schwaben, Franken, and Dürrenuhlsdorf, will open their yards and gardens to sell treasures and trinkets. This marks the very first Hofflohmärkte in Waldenburg, and we are thrilled to hunt for bargains and, most importantly, to connect with our neighbors and explore new corners of our town.

We hope that this event will become an annual tradition, fostering community spirit and engagement. The platform is open source and hosted by [Kleinodd Buch & Café](http://www.kleinodd.de) in Waldenburg.

For any questions, please get in touch with Kleinodd.

## Event Details

Participants can plan their Hofflohmarkt route using the digital map available at [waldenburg-hofflohmaerkte.kleinodd.de](https://waldenburghofmarkt.kleinodd.de). You can register your stand until **October 25th at 18:00**. After this deadline, we will finalize the list of stands and print the map to create an analog experience for everyone involved.

Are you joining us? Did you score an amazing bargain or meet wonderful people? Share your experiences using our hashtag **#hofflohmarkt_wbg** and showcase the vibrant and treasure-hunting spirit of our city!
